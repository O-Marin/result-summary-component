## My process

 With this one I had to rethink how I approach the challenges, I realized I was making mistakes and had presupositions that shouldn't there.
 I hope I carry the lessons foward. I started learning javascript basics after tackling the bonus in this challenge, so my code was a mess(maybe still is),
 and started over a couple times, each time a bit more tidy, hopefully reaching a state where it's comprehensible for most if not all.
 
 I don't really know what to add in this segment. Probably its more personal, like a space for me to stop a think of what I've learned.
 I took way too long for this one but in the during the challenge I realized I needed to walk and get some sun time, and "fresh" air.
 It does help in clearning the mind and thinking more peacefully.
 
 I don't know if this is a good practice or common but it's not the first time I try deleting code and start it over applying what I have learned, to get out
 of a "lock-state", sort of a reset. the second or third code is tidier. It helps me use a different approach instead of tunneling into the one I thought it had to be.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- Fetch API



### What I learned
How to use CSS gradients
How to use fetch() to grab data from a .json file and use it in my webpage.
Trained my loops.


### Continued development

I need to practice loops more and in different situations to develop a more intuitive understanding of how they work.
